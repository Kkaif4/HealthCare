    <p><b>Calorie Tracking:</b></p>
    \n
    <p>
      Use a calorie tracking app (MyFitnessPal, Healthifyme) to log your daily
      intake. Aim for around 2500-2800 calories per day, with a macronutrient
      split of roughly 40% carbohydrates, 30% protein, and 30% fat. This is an
      estimate and may need adjustment based on your individual metabolism and
      activity levels. Weigh yourself weekly (at the same time) and adjust your
      calorie intake based on your progress.
